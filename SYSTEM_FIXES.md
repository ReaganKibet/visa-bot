## 🚀 How to Start the System

### Option 1: Use the startup script (Windows)
```bash
start_system.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual startup
```bash
# Stop any running containers
docker-compose down

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build -d

# Wait for services to start
# Then run tests
python test_system.py
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

1. **Run the test script**: `python test_system.py`
2. **Open the dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
3. **Check API docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## 📋 What Should Work Now

1. ✅ **Start Monitoring**: Click "Start Monitoring" - should create a monitor
2. ✅ **View Logs**: Real-time logs should appear in the dashboard
3. ✅ **Start Booking**: Click "Start Booking" - should open browser (in Docker)
4. ✅ **Stop Monitoring**: Click "Stop Monitoring" - should stop the monitor
5. ✅ **View Monitors**: See all monitors and their status

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If browser doesn't open:
```bash
# Check worker logs
docker-compose logs worker

# Look for these messages:
# "🌐 Launching browser for APPL-1001"
# "🔧 Starting Chromium browser..."
# "✅ Browser launched successfully"
```

### If monitoring doesn't start:
```bash
# Check API logs
docker-compose logs api

# Look for monitor creation messages
```

### If database issues:
```bash
# Check database logs
docker-compose logs db

# Restart database
docker-compose restart db
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **Monitoring**: Should check VFS site every 60 seconds
2. **Logs**: Should show "🔍 Checking slots..." messages
3. **Booking**: Should open browser and wait for manual completion
4. **Dashboard**: Should show real-time updates via WebSocket

## 📞 Next Steps

Once the system is running correctly:
1. Test the complete flow end-to-end
2. Add auto-fill functionality after verification
3. Add PDF capture and email features
4. Deploy to a cloud server if needed

The system is now much more robust and should work correctly!
